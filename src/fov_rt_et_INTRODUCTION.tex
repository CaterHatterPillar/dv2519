\section{Introduction}
Ray tracing has long since been used for computer graphics, both in offline and real-time scenarios, some real-time use-cases impressively stretching as far back as an 1987 CAD-application\cite{stay87}.
Recently, the fast progression of modern processors have accomodated for more extensive use of ray tracing technologies, as demonstrated by Intel Corporation with their reseach project Quake Wars: Ray Traced in 2009\cite{pohl09}, an implementation of the Id Software video game Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, popularizing the idea of ray tracing renderers for consumer video games.
