Abstract:
* Remove paragraphs to reduce whitespace.
* We present an open-source implementation of foveated real-time rendering demonstrating the potential performance benefits of foveation in ray tracing.

Conclusion:
* Mention that the histograms are subdivided into 50 bins.
* Spread in histograms could be due to the, during the experiment, rotating model.
* Other future improvements, mainly for user experience, include:
* * Blurring edges of fovs to reduce their direct noticability.
* * Use a stencil algorithm / stencil buffer for the purposes of rendering circular FOVs rather than square/rectangular ones. With no direct corners, the FOVs may be less noticable.
* As such, we conclude that the performance benefits of foveation demonstrated by previous studies (cite Microsoft paper) in rasterization does extend to ray tracing.

Other:
* Add attribution and thank David for contributing with the model. Consider having the attribution and link to the solution under the same section.
* The submission has to be anonymous. Remove name and things (look up in the LaTeX style how this is to be done).

Notes:
* Try to get rid of as many section as possible.
* If you need additional space, try using another package for the ray tracing pseudo code.
* Look up some tips and tricks for reducing whitespace if you need more space.
* If you need space, you could always remove the subsections under the Background section, as the headers themselves take up a whole lot of room.
